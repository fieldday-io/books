The primary audience of this book are users who have some working knowledge on incus virtualization platform and would like to understand better on how to configure incus into a multi-tenant platform. The goal is to guide the reader in leveraging incus capabilities and features namely projects, open virtual networking, access control lists and many more to gain an overall understanding in building a minimal multi-tenant system on a single server.

This book explores only a bare minimal design needed for multi-tenancy with regards to storage and networking to gain some insights. This book is not meant to teach the basics of incus virtualization platform. Please refer to the credits section at the end of this book that provide links to the best teachers on incus. 

For a complete beginner to incus virtualization platform, I would recommend to start with Trevor Sullivanâ€™s YouTube playlist on LXD containers.

The approach taken in this book is very Hands-on. It explains incus multi-tenancy by breaking it down not as chapters but a list of tasks, each task dependent on the completion of its previous task. 

The recommended way to learn from this book is to use it as a Cookbook. By having a dedicated server and trying out all the tasks in the same order.

Happy learning :-)
